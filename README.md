## Who Am I
<img align="right" width="320" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExbTZhMWFjZWU0ZjA5ZGY0YzQ5NzVkYjE1YzI5YjE1YjE5MjE5MjE5ZCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZzX2dpZklkJmN0PWc/RbDKaczqWovIugyJmW/giphy.gif" />

Backend developer who genuinely enjoys reading RFC documents and database whitepapers. Yes, we exist.

- Built things that scaled, broke them, learned why, rebuilt them better
- Care more about thread safety than UI animations
- Think "microservices" is usually overkill but understand when it isn't
- Will argue about database normalization forms over lunch
- Believe the best comment is code that doesn't need one

**Philosophy:** Most "senior" advice is just "I made this mistake already so you don't have to."

**Reality check:** Still Google "how to exit vim" occasionally.

## Currently Working On
<img align="right" width="300" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ZVik7pBtu9dNS/giphy.gif" />

- Building APIs that don't return 500 when someone types an emoji
- Understanding why distributed systems are distributed depression
- Making Go do things that JavaScript developers think are impossible
- Writing tests (fine, *actually* writing tests this time)
- Figuring out why my localhost works but production laughs at me

**Recent accomplishment:** Reduced database query time from 4 seconds to 80ms. Felt like a god for 10 minutes until I found a memory leak.

**Current struggle:** Explaining to myself why I thought nested callbacks were a good idea in 2023.

## Tech Arsenal

**Languages that pay my bills:**
<p>
  <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cpp,js,ts,go,python" />
</p>

**BackendStack (my comfort zone):**
<p>
  <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=nodejs,express,mongodb,postgres,redis,docker" />
</p>

**Frontend (I can make it work, not make it pretty):**
<p>
  <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=react,nextjs,tailwind" />
</p>

**Daily drivers:**
<p>

<sub>Also comfortable with: REST, GraphQL, JWT, OAuth, and other acronyms that make me sound smart at parties</sub>

## Problem Solving Philosophy
<img align="right" width="300" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPnAiaMCws8nOsE/giphy.gif" />

**Approach:**
- Read the problem twice. Solve it once. Debug it seventeen times.
- Brute force first, optimize later (or when the interviewer gives that look)
- Test with empty arrays, null values, and user input that seems designed to break things
- If it passes all test cases but feels wrong, it's probably wrong

**LeetCode stats:** More mediums than easy problems because apparently I hate myself.

**Debugging style:** Print statements everywhere until the bug gets embarrassed and leaves.

**Unpopular opinion:** Sometimes the O(n²) solution that you understand is better than the O(n) solution you copied from Stack Overflow.

## Honest Stats About My Coding Life
<img align="right" width="260" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ZEB6yFbLnhyQf7g3hn/giphy.gif" />

**My commits tell stories:**
- 60% - "fix", "fixed", "actually fixed", "I swear it's fixed now"
- 20% - "refactor" (renamed one variable)
- 15% - "working on it" (not working on it)
- 5% - Actual descriptive commit messages

**Time spent coding:**
- 10% writing new code
- 30% debugging my code
- 40% debugging someone else's code
- 20% wondering why I became a developer

**Documentation habits:**
- Write detailed docs for others: Sometimes
- Read documentation before asking: Rarely
- Assume the docs are outdated: Always

## Real Talk: What I Actually Believe

**Good code is:**
- Easy to delete
- Hard to misuse
- Honest about what it does
- Boring (boring is good)

**Learning means:**
- Breaking things on purpose
- Reading error messages instead of panicking
- Admitting "I don't know" before pretending
- Stealing ideas from smarter people

**Career advice nobody asked for:**
- Build things that solve real problems, even small ones
- Your GitHub stars don't matter as much as what you learned
- Being stuck is normal; staying stuck is optional
- Production errors teach more than any tutorial
